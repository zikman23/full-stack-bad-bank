MITxPro Capstone - Full Stack Banking App

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

## Overview

Bad Bank Project is a unsecure banking application that simulates a create account function, a login, deposit, withdraw and an all data summary page. The project was created using standalone Single Page React Routing as well as styling with Bootstrap.

This is a simple React app that presents the user with an ATM-like interface, with options to deposit or withdraw money, as well as display the current account balance. The goals of this exercise include:

1. Implement user-friendly UI and React components
2. Manage state of various UI elements
3. Validate form content in conjunction with state of other components

## Features & Improvements

The exercise included the following details, which are implemented in the app:

- Adding validation so users canâ€™t withdraw more money than the account balance
- Modifying the user interface to require users to select deposit or withdraw before an input field is visible

I styled the app using basic CSS in order to give it a cleaner interface.

I attempted to implement dropdown menus and buttons using Bootstrap, but was unsuccessful at the time of submission. I plan to go back and complete the UI improvements.
